## Rival Robotics
RIVAL Robotics Competition is a robotics competition for all ages targeted at advanced builders. There are multiple events with a different challange each year. For more information, visit https://www.rivalrobotics.co/

## Overview
UDON V2 is a shooter robot meant to compete in the Rival Robotics Competition. Its main goal is to shoot missiles (badminton shuttlecock) onto platforms on the goal post.

This robot intakes the missiles off the ground to shoot it up into the L2 platforms. It also has the ability to "silo dump" or drop all the missiles out of the tube. The EDF on the back of the robot allows for large area "acquisition" of the missiles and blow it to the other side.

### Why?
UDON V2 was created in order to explore further levels of advanced robotics. Coming from an FRC and Robotics background, UDON acts as a way to build and learn skills as well as grow the RIVAL community. Tonkotsu Tech, the overarching group overseeing UDON, has made contributions to RIVALS and wishes to continue that through UDON.

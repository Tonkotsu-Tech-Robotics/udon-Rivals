## Overview
UDON V2 is a shooter robot meant to compete in the Rival Robotics Competition. Its main goal is to shoot missles (badminton shuttlecock) onto platforms on the goal post.

This robot intakes the missles off the ground to shoot it up into the L2 platforms. It also has the ability to "silo dump" or drop all the missles out of the tube. The EDF on the back of the robot allows for large area "aquisition" of the missles and blow it to the other side.
